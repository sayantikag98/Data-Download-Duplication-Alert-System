# Data Download Duplication Alert System (DDAS)

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

âš  **This project is under development and currently serves as a design showcase.** The implementation is ongoing, and the repository does not yet contain code. This README documents the planned architecture and features for future implementation.

## Overview
The **Data Download Duplication Alert System (DDAS)** is designed to efficiently process and detect duplicate download requests at scale. The system ensures low latency, high throughput, and robust security to prevent unauthorized or excessive downloads.

## Introduction
Organizations offering downloadable contentâ€”such as datasets, reports, or softwareâ€”often face challenges related to duplicate downloads. These may result from abuse, accidental re-downloads, or network issues. **DDAS** provides an efficient mechanism to detect and alert administrators about duplicate downloads based on configurable thresholds.

### Objectives
- **Prevent Abuse**: Detect and flag excessive duplicate downloads.
- **Ensure Performance**: Handle high request volumes with minimal latency.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provide dashboards and alerting mechanisms.
- **Guarantee Security**: Implement robust authentication and encryption standards.

## Features (Planned & Implemented)
âœ… **Duplicate Detection** using Bloom filters, in-memory caches, and database verification.  
âœ… **Rate Limiting** to enforce user and IP-based restrictions.  
ðŸš§ **Real-Time Alerting** (Planned) - Integrating Email, Slack, and PagerDuty notifications.  
ðŸš§ **Monitoring & Logging** (Planned) - Using Prometheus and ELK Stack.  
âœ… **Scalability** with horizontal scaling support.  
ðŸš§ **Admin API** (Upcoming) - Configurable thresholds and limits.  
âœ… **Secure API Gateway** with JWT/OAuth2 authentication.  

## Architecture
The system consists of multiple components working together to efficiently detect and alert duplicate downloads.

### **High-Level Architecture**
- **Client Layer**: Web, mobile, and external API consumers.
- **API Gateway & Authentication**: Routes requests, enforces rate limits, and manages authentication.
- **Download Request Processing Module**:
  - Hash Generation (MurmurHash/xxHash, SHA-256 for security-sensitive cases).
  - Duplicate Detection using Bloom Filters, LRU Cache, and Database.
  - Rate Limiting with Token Bucket/Leaky Bucket algorithms.
- **Persistent Storage & Data Retention**:
  - PostgreSQL/DynamoDB for operational data.
  - Time-windowed sliding logs with compression.
- **In-Memory Caching & Messaging**:
  - Redis Cluster with `appendfsync everysec` for persistence.
  - Kafka for asynchronous event processing.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js / Java / Python (Planned Implementation)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / DynamoDB
- **Cache**: Redis Cluster
- **Message Queue**: Kafka
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth2
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker

## Future Implementation Plan
Since this project is currently in the design phase, the following steps outline the planned implementation process:
1. **Prototype Development**: Implement core functionality in a minimal viable form.
2. **Duplicate Detection Engine**: Integrate Bloom filters, in-memory cache, and database checks.
3. **Rate Limiting & API Gateway**: Establish user-based and IP-based rate limits.
4. **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
5. **Alerting System**: Integrate Slack, PagerDuty, and email notifications.
6. **Final Optimization & Scaling**: Ensure the system performs at scale with high availability.
